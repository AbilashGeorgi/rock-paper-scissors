ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
****************************************

rock paper scissors game with a basic UI.

UI is not as finished as I wanted it to be.

~~Async execution causing problems in clearing the main text field but too much time spent on it for now.~~
Some extra animations were avoided.

Watch this video on event loop for understanding async execution : _[JS EVENT LOOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)_

---

Could add images instead of just text.
some more animations were being thought of but not implemented.
